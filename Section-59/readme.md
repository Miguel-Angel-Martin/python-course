Day 59 Goals: What you'll make by the end of today
Blog upgrade

Previously we've built a simple blog with simple CSS styling. It had no fancy animations and was not mobile responsive. Now that we've learnt all about Bootstrap and how much time it can save us, we're going to upgrade our blog with the power of Bootstrap.

The best part? We don't even have to write the Bootstrap code.



Bootstrap Templates
On the internet, there are hundreds of thousands of free Bootstrap templates. Beautifully designed websites using Bootstrap that are ready to go. All we need is to understand how Bootstrap works (Day 58) and then we can simply customise these beautiful websites for our own purposes.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/
