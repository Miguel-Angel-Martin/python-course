# Day 66 Goals: Build Your Own REST API Service

On day 33, we learnt about APIs and since then, we've used a number of public APIs. e.g ISS location, Trivia Questions and Twilio. In a lot of cases, the API allows us to tap into a particular website's data or service.

Many companies have collected valuable data e.g. Bitcoin prices, Restaurant reviews and provide an API for developers to access this data for a price. Depending on how valuable the data/service is behind the API, these APIs can charge anywhere from $9 to $99 per month for access. Some even charge per API call.

What if you have access to some information that other people might want to use? E.g. You collected data on all the cafes in a particular city and figured out which ones were suitable for remote-work? Then you could create an API and charge people to access your data.

But how do you create an API?

That's what we'll tackle in today's lessons. Building a full REST API from scratch using Flask.
