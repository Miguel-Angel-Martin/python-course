What is a Header?

When making a request to Amazon or any website, your browser will send some additional data along with the request. Typically this will be information regarding what browser you are using, what computer you have, and what your preferred language is. This information is included in the headers. By using the headers, Amazon's server can respond with the right website for your region and your language.
